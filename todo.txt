-   insert piece coordinate is bad for newing
-   king not be checked before moves
-   current.x = coordinate.x;
            current.y = coordinate.y;

-   Piece currentPiece = GetPiece(current);
-   big optimization for BishopPossibleMoves and RookPossibleMoves (we don't need to check blank square)
